       "    'text': \"You come here for the view of the beach which is the main attraction especially if you get a good seat. I decided to take my wife here for her birthday so I made reservations ahead of time off OpenTable and told them we were celebrating a birthday so I wanted a table with good view of the water. We arrived early and use their valet parking because it's easier than finding street parking. The valet cost is already added to your bill so you don't have to worry about cash except for tip. We arrived early so we took advantage on walking down to the beach first. We checked in like 20 minutes before our reservation time but they were still able to seat us with a great table with good view of the water. Our waiter was Marvin and we thought he was great with us beside not telling me that the soda is not free refill. That was my only complaint with him but I didn't want to dispute so I just paid it but give less in the tip. My wife got the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass for her entree and a Georgia Peach martini for her drink. I got their Herb Crusted Salmon and ask for french fries for my sides. My wife loved her peach martini and of course her Sea Bass. I thought the Salmon was a bit dry and didn't have much favor but Marvin came around asking if I wanted crushed black pepper so I asked for that on the Salmon and fries. It helped a little but not that much to me. We finish off the night with a ice cream dessert where Marvin sang Happy Birthday to my wife. I would recommend coming here and making reservations if you want to experience a good view and some good food but just know that the soda does not have free refills.\",\n",

Still same great service, food, and atmosphere!  Keep in mind if you choose to park on your own, good luck!  Highly recommend either car service or valet. The valet crew is so awesome and as always takes care of everyone with a smile! They were great with our driver. Super polite and accommodating when he dropped us off and picked us up.\\nWe love to sit at the bar.  If you do this make sure you sit on the far side so you can see the ocean.  Our bartender was great!  Lots of personality and really enjoyed our time there.\\nThe food as always was excellent! We went on a Sunday.  Sat and Sunday they have a great brunch menu.',\n",

For appetizers, we had the chips and guacamole, and the portion was huge, definitely enough for sharing. The fish and chips were on point, with crispy fries that were delicious. The chicken tacos were also packed with flavor.\\n\\nSome of the drinks came in actual pineapples and watermelons, which was a fun tropical touch! The view of the ocean was incredible and made for some perfect photo ops. Just a heads up, though: it can get a little chilly when the sun goes down depending on the time of the year, so bring a light jacket if you plan to stay into the evening.\\n\\nOverall, it‚Äôs the perfect spot to relax, enjoy great food and drinks, and take in the Malibu vibe. The ocean view is unbeatable, especially for photo ops. The only downside was that the staff seemed a bit overworked and tired, and I didn‚Äôt see many smiles, which might have been because it was the end of the weekend. Hopefully, that‚Äôs not always the case. Despite that, I‚Äôll definitely be coming back!',\n",

       "    'text': \"The starters were a disappointment. We ordered a pork belly and a salmon tartare. One of the 3 pieces of pork belly was literally just a piece of fat with no meat at all. Very fatty and greasy, which you would expect of a pork belly, but everything has limits. And then the sauce and that toast - the dish all together had a fast-food taste profile. Do not recommend. The salmon tartare tasted just like lemon and pretty much no other flavor to it. Very plain, not interesting. Absolutely not worth the calorie budget and the money budget too. Game meats, on the other hand, were a pure delight! We ordered a trio plus the quail and a duck breast - everything was just greatüëå Elk was tender and delicious, rabbit was flavorful, bison was very bright, and quail... well, that's just a quail, can't expect much from it, but it was good. And I liked the duck breast cooked to perfection with the sweet notes from dark cherries. All meats came with great matching sides - just really good!\\nSo if you like me don't like to put mediocre food inside of your body, my good advice to you is skip the starters and go straight to main courses. That's what's worth it! ‚ù§Ô∏è I will be back for that game trio for sure!\",\n",

They only have outdoor seating where you seat yourself and the popular spot to sit at is at the patio which is elevated and comes with a great view.\\n\\nIt was a Sunday afternoon after a day at the beach when we came Malibu Seafood for a late lunch with friends. To start off there is definitely a line, we waited roughly 20 minutes to put in our order, and a long line means a lot of orders so we waited almost 40 minutes to get our food. When you order you get a ticket and there is a speaker system used when the order is ready to be picked up at the window.\\n\\nWe ordered the 2 piece fish & chips, the lobster roll, New England clam chowder and trout. The food had no issues. The New England clam chowder had a generous amount of clams, tasted good and was served piping hot. The fish and chips tasted good, was a decent portion and served hot, the fries were on the thicker side and tasted decent. The lobster roll is definitely one to order again. The trout did not live up to its price tag. There is a relatively large menu to choose from so feel free to explore.\\n\\nThere was a little parking lot which was completely full but rotated frequently enough where a spot would have probably opened up eventually if we waited long enough, but we found parking on the street, which is PCH.\\n\\nOverall, it‚Äôs a decent spot with decent food, great for wrapping up a day at the beach. We‚Äôve been here multiple times and plan to go many time more in the future.',\n",

We were very excite to try the lobster rolls, but were ultimately disappointed. It was nothing special for $30 a roll, save your money. The best part of the meal was the fish and chips. We ordered two pieces and it was plenty for my fianc√©e and I. The batter was delicious and the fish was very juicy. I haven't had many fish and chips platters, but this was certainly the best. The fries and coleslaw were also great pairings. The Clam chowder was also delicious, different from what we were used to, but still very good. This is a great place to stop for lunch along Pacific Coast Highway. The line can get long, but the service is quick and there is plenty of seating. I recommend parking along the road to avoid having to pay for the lot.\",\n",

We went to the beach for a few hours and then we planned on coming to Dukes in Malibu for lunch date and the view of the ocean which was so beautiful. I got the prime sirloin steak and fries with a side salad and it was really delicious.  The server was really nice and accommodating.  As you could see in the pictures, there's plenty of seating inside the restaurant and they have an attached party space for large groups of people who wanna rent out the space.  The ambience at Dukes is very chill and relaxing with a view of the ocean. I mean how can it get better than that?  There is no street parking as far as I can tell and only a valet parking lot in front of the restaurant that was the only downside of Dukes.  I would definitely recommend Dukes for anybody who's in Malibu and wants to have a good lunch or dinner with the view of the ocean.  Amen and yes please.\",\n",

Must have.\\n\\nYou also can‚Äôt ever go wrong with some bakhlava.\\n\\nSide note:\\nParking is difficult to find! So make sure to give yourself extra time for that as there is no valet.',\n",

There was little to no wait and plenty of parking while other places in the area had hour+ wait times and limited/paid parking. This place does not have an ocean view but has a wide selection of delicious food choices. Our only issue was that we ordered a few burgers rare- medium rare and they all came out medium well - well done. To their credit, the manager came over and offered us several options for remedy the situation. Other than that it was a great environment with a full bar and wide menu. I would give it another try.',\n",

Our server was great, and we had a great chat with the manager.\\n\\nThe matzo ball soup was delicious, a great way to start a meal. The broth was so flavourful and my mom loved the matzo ball.\\n\\nThey have a selection of preset pizzas (which my mom went for - she got the wild mushroom & spinach pizza and loved it), my dad and I made our own pizza. He got Hawaiian (ham & pineapple) and I got a very loaded pizza haha, you pay per topping so before you go wild like me, keep in mind it can get expensive quickly. Worth every penny though!\\n\\nThe dessert was delicious, we almost ordered a second one after we finished the first.\\n\\nThe blackberry lemon drop cocktail was delicious. Very refreshing and fruity!\\n\\nTheir patio is covered and dog friendly!\\n\\nWill definitely be coming back next time we‚Äôre in Malibu! 10/10 would recommend. The interior and vibe is great too.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Located at the very end of the Malibu Pier, the location is hard to beat and the food is honestly a great accompaniment to the scenery. We were able to sit right outside on the pier and watched all the surfers during our brunch. You order at the counter, take a number, and then they bring everything out to you. They also have outdoor roof seating but we were able to find a table on the first level. Parking can be a bit tricky, especially if you are searching for a spot on the street, but we parked in the parking lot associated with the pier for $15.\\n\\nEverything we ordered came out really quickly and the portion sizes were very fair. We started with a Honey Iced Latte and it was actually very good. It really had a nice smooth flavor. Being our first time we wanted to order a few items so we chose the Swedish Mini Pancakes, the Egg Sandwich, and the Surfers Rancheros. All of them were honestly very good. The Egg Sandwich was really light and packed with flavor, the egg was cooked perfectly and oozed out of every bite. The Swedish Pancakes were fairly good, I am just not a big fan of Swedish food. I really want to be, but I just don‚Äôt tend to like their sweets, bakery, or breakfast items. They‚Äôre very small pancakes, the size of a silver dollar, but not as good as a Dutch Baby in my opinion. Lastly, the Scramble was honestly great and it was a very large sized portion. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sauce on top was really good.\\n\\nOverall, we had a great brunch and really enjoyed the location, this is the sort of place you would want to sit for a bit especially on a nice day. I would come more often if parking were free and easier to find.',\n",

We had to line up before seating ourselves on the pier overlooking the ocean for breakfast. The line went fast, our drinks came out within 5-10 mins and our food came out not long after that. Each server was so kind, especially Zane who was able to give us information on the mugs for purchase and get us extra condiments when we asked. The location and view was especially beautiful, and they have a gift shop right outside the cafe for souvenirs. Will definitely come back next time I‚Äôm in Malibu.',\n",

Fresh clams in a light wine sauce. She really enjoyed it. I got the vegetable risotto w chicken added to it. They add as much grated cheese as you'd like tableside, so mine had 3 scoops.

       "    'text': \"I walked into the store about 10 minutes after they opened to order an americano, it coast almost 6 dollars. Then I picked a corner table and went to plug in my phone and of course no power sockets are available at this location. Then after I sat down I realized the table I chose had super dried crumbs on it and sticky spots from the day before. I washed off the table with napkins and then walked up to the counter to ask for the bathroom code. I was ignored while 3 people helped make one drink for a customer, I stood there waiting for over 10 minutes not being talked to until someone else walked into the store and stood behind me to start to create a line, I asked for the bathroom code and he said 28484, the code did not work, I walked back to the counter and waited a long time until the same guy looked at me then turned away to ignore me so I spoke what was that bathroom code, the same guy said a different number, 24842. I tryed it and it didn't work, I walked back to my table and grabbed my pen and asked what the number was and he said a totally different number, 24824,  wrote it on my hand, that one worked. I'm very good at listening and I'm very good with numbers, I don't enjoy being toyed with, I'm an adult and I act and treat others like adults. I did my duty, even though they had just opened the large trash can in the bathroom was full, their was dirt and sand on the floor, a stain of soap on the floor under the soap dish and black scuff marks from shoes all over the sides of the toilet and on the floor. Not to mention the dry piss along the back of the toilet and under the seat. I went to my table to work on the book I'm writing. I wrote a few pages and then my pen ran out of ink so I kindly asked the new lady behind the counter to borrow a pen to finish what I was writing before I could finish my sentence she yelled NO we don't have extra pens and turned to talk with the 2 boys. As I walked away and a nice lady in the lobby gave me one of her pens and told me to keep it. I finished writing and needed another coffee, I asked for a 2nd americano and was charged a different price for the same size coffee (this difference in price happens everyday when I order the same exact kind of coffee at all your locations) then I watched the guy use the drip coffee machine and not make an americano. Even though I was charged for an Americano. I'm very disguised by the ignorance i have received at this location. The 2 people that opened the store and the lady that showed up shortly after all where extremely rude towards me but was extremely nice towards everyone else. We're in Malibu and this is how your town treats people?! I spend over 10 dollars on 2 black coffees to be treated like someone begging for a free cup of coffee. I'm a human just like all the other humans why I am I treated  less then one when I came into this location. I've never been here and I'll never be back. I will no longer enter a Starbucks period, this was my final straw. I will call corporate office later today when I'm able to charge my phone. Thank you for the lovely waste of time and the stretching of my patience this morning. Thats how someone likes to start their day.\",\n",

The melted cheese, beans, and salsa set this burrito off no matter what meat you choose. I highly recommend opting for chorizo. If I‚Äôm in Malibu on a Sunday morning, there‚Äôs no doubt I‚Äôm stopping at Lily‚Äôs. Place your order online though and give them 40min-1 hour to make it - they get busy for a reason! Well-worth the wait. You will never be disappointed by Lily‚Äôs!',\n",

       "    'text': \"I tried this place about 6 months ago when I was in search of a Taco Tuesday deal. Unfortunately, this place had no such thing.\\n\\nI ordered two tacos (steak and salmon) and they were served with beans and rice. I got a beer with it and my bill totaled about $25, which wasn't really ideal, but I really enjoyed the food nonetheless.\\n\\nThe meat quality was very good. Both had a very soft texture and it seemed to just melt in your mouth. They were also seasoned very appropriately; not too much and not too little.\\n\\nThe texture of the beans were so smooth that they were almost creamy.\\n\\nEven the rice was nice and moist with lots of flavor.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were pretty good as well.\\n\\nI really liked the atmosphere of this place. It had somewhat of an elegant, high end appearance inside, but had more of a cozy feel as I was sitting at the bar.\\n\\nThe bartender was very personable and friendly. The place was not that crowded, so we chitchated about hiking, basketball, and some other things about the LA area. It's definitely always good talking to locals about what to do in the area.\\n\\nOverall, while this wasn't particularly the kind of place that I had in mind, the food was very good. The prices aren't low but the quality does kind of make up for it.\",\n",

Here, not only healthy drinks but also various stores where you can spend your day productively are abundant. The smoothies here are the epitome of health. All the ingredients are fresh, and no matter what menu you choose, they generously fill the smoothie with ingredients without skimping. Of course, customization according to personal preferences is also possible. If you are interested in health, serious about dieting, and interested in delaying aging, I recommend this store.\",\n",

       "    'text': 'Open and in business since 1970 and tucked away deep in the Agoura Hills, The Old Place is a truly unique dining experience for Los Angeles and it really feels like you are eating in a different county and time.When you pull up, it looks like a series of old western buildings, but also cozy enough and that you immediately want to check it out. Parking in the area is kind of tricky but if there aren‚Äôt any spaces available in the parking lot behind the restaurant, it‚Äôs easy to park in the neighborhood directly next to the restaurant. You will have to walk a block at most. There was a bit of confusion when I booked reservations for dinner. We have been for lunch before where they served steak sandwiches and you have to eat outside, but I wanted to stop in again for indoor dining. I didn‚Äôt realize when I booked the reservation that you need to be a party of three or more to reserve a table. When I arrived, they told me this, but it was not a problem being that the bar is quite large and many others were eating at it as well. We were a party of two and could comfortably fit and ate our whole meal at the bar.\\n\\nThey have a fairly limited menu but a ton of hearty classics that will really fill your belly. They obviously have a very large drink menu as well so whatever you are in the mood for you, you‚Äôll be able to find here. For our meal, we started off with one of the specials of the day, which was the Fried Pickles. To our surprise they were whole pickles and breaded just like fish and chips, so it really was a pleasant surprise. For our entr√©es, we chose the Bone-In Filet Mignon 16 ounce and the Chicken Pot Pie. The filet was cooked perfectly and seasoned well and I truly enjoyed it. There is such a little fat on the filet that you can pretty much eat the entire thing which is my favorite part. The baked potato that they serve with it is gigantic and honestly delicious. It was lacking sour cream, otherwise it was perfect. The Chicken Pot Pie was also a unique take on the classic dish and the puff pastry was crispy and delicious just like I hoped.\\n\\nOverall, this is a really fun place to have lunch or dinner and the drive out is a big part of the charm. It‚Äôs really nice to get out of the city and The Old Place is a great destination to mix up your dining locations. I would recommend to anyone for any occasion.',\n",

The history of this restaurant and its surrounding buildings is well worth a read. The actual restaurant is small and rugged but charming at the same time. Walking into the Old Place takes you back in time with its historic bar, appropriately distributed architectural elements and cozy dining booths. The whole property is a fun place to explore and take in the natural beauty of this old family owned property. The food here is legit and the service comes with a healthy dose of old school family charm. Definitely recommend making reservations if you plan to eat.

Overall the pizza lacked flavor. The sauce, the cheese and even the crust were just ordinary. Nothing to write home about. I love a nice pizza crust, this dough is lighter than usual for a pizza. Also very pricey!! I almost had a cow when he said $60 for a 12\" specialty pizza, 2 slices of regular pizza and a small slice of cake. No drinks at all. $60!!! So my expectations were a little higher, as I was expecting some amazing pizza, but sadly nothing special about it.',\n",

After we ordered, multiple parties showed up after us and got their food before us, and the manager came out to talk with them and be friendly and ask about their service. Turns out it‚Äôs another store owner in the area. Not one single person asked us if we‚Äôd like our drinks refilled or to give us any context as to why the food was taking so long for a burger and an order of fish and chips. 85 minutes later we finally had someone walk close enough for us to ASK if our food was going to be out‚Ä¶.only for the waiter to tell us that he hadn‚Äôt even put the order in. After we got the food, which was below par at best, we were completely avoided by all the staff. No water refills, no asking if the food was good, nothing. Im still sitting at the table waiting for the check, credit card on the corner of the table and all of our dishes and glasses stacked and they still have yet to come back‚Ä¶2 HOURS after we sat. Easily the worst service I‚Äôve ever had in my life. DO NOT COME HERE!',\n",

I usually don't post anything where it's only negative. So in the positive in the past the service has been fabulous. The food delicious. However, very shocked of my experience yesterday where the food came out cold but still delicious. The staff dilatory at best or lazy or overwhelmed. Either way. For a place that you expect to spend $200 to $300 for a meal, it should be better now. It's not La Maurice in Paris where you spend $1,000 for a table for two experience. A 4-H meal. That is something to absolutely remember the rest of your life it's just a dinner so service is important. Food shouldn't come late. The check should not be confusing. And honestly, after spending $1,200 for our small group yesterday, I'm surprised and disappointed\",\n",

The food was uninspired and the service too casual for the price-point. The cold crab leg app was tasteless and the house cocktail sauce served with it watery. The duck/mushroom spring rolls were tasty and very petite. Our entrees were underwhelming. Tiger prawns with pasta and lobster reduction was disappointing. The shrimp were the same size and quality that we purchase from Costco for home meals. The flavor of the sauce bland. The beef short rib with pasta was okay, but again not very flavorful. In the middle of the meal our server decided it was time to hand dry and stack plates in the middle of the dining room just 3 feet from our table. Rather unpleasant noise when dining. Last time we were in the area we went to Duke's down the road. That's where we'll go next time.\",\n",

I made reservations ahead of time here to come get breakfast for my wife birthday. I put in the reservation that we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived, we took advantage of their valet parking because finding street parking will be tough here. The valet is cash only and it's not that expensive. We got seated at a table next to a small waterfall and the atmosphere inside the dining is such spectacular. The person who got us water was very nice and told us to go look at their buffet if we wanted to do that option. We took a look at the buffet and they had some nice selection but it wasn't to our liking so we left the room and look at more nature views. When we came back our waitress came to the table and I told her we were celebrating my wife birthday. My wife got the Salmon dish with Mimosas and I just got their grass fed burger. It took a while for our food to come out but we just enjoyed the nature sound and the waterfall sound. When our food came out, my wife loved her salmon dish. She said the salmon was tender and the sauce was amazing. I thought the burger was just alright, nothing too special about it to me and I did not like the fries. I couldn't even finish it because it wasn't tasty to me. It took a while for someone to come take our plates then it took a long time for our waitress to come back just for me to ask for the check. They didn't get my wife a complimentary dessert so that was the downside of our dining experience and also the availability of our waitress. I would recommend coming here just to enjoy the view and appreciate some of their dishes here.\",\n",

Not only do we have so many positive things to say about the Inn, but our guests were thoroughly impressed too. First, the setting is gorgeous. \"Fairy tale garden\" was used by more than one person to describe the ambience. The staff were so friendly and attentive and made us and our guests feel welcome and at ease. The fact that the Inn does a lot of weddings, and has a dedicated wedding coordinator, eased our worries throughout the wedding planning process because they know what they\\'re doing! They run a tight ship for weddings and it was all smooth sailing :) Several guests mentioned how good the food was - we served all vegetarian food, which was incredible to have as an option and the fact that it pleased the entire crowd should be commended. The Inn offers the right amount of customization options for weddings (food, linens, decor, layout) to make it feel personal while keeping enough consistency to deliver a solid wedding service. The Inn is a classic LA wedding venue for a reason!\\n\\nThese photos by Christy Kendall (one of the Inn\\'s recommended photographers - book her!) capture just a little bit of how magical and special the Inn is.',\n",

Reel Inn which seems to be frequent by locals. They may not have the best view (just across if you want to see the coast)\\n\\nThe food look amazing when we enter the place, free and easy, choose your own seat and head to the counter to order and pick up yourself once they call your name.\\n\\nWe ordered their crab cake appetizer which comes with 2 sides.\\n\\nMonkfish with eggs in Cajun style was fantastic, highlight of the meal, the spice gave enough kick to get you to finish the entire dish, the rice was chewy and goes so well, there is some smoky flavours to it which must have come from the Cajun marinade. Fish was fresh and meaty, love it. Goes with their really fresh coleslaw, perfect meal.\\n\\nWe ordered both soups available, fish chowder is minestrone on steroid with chunks of vegs and chunks of fish. New English clam chowder has huge pieces of clam inside, gives lots of bites in every spoonful.\\n\\nCrab cakes was zero potato & 99% crab meat in there, mash potato was perfectly done just as we expect in US, and goes well with the steamed veges. Drizzle some hot sauce on it, yummmz\\n\\nOn the lighter side, we ordered an Ahi Salad too, what was really great was the generous amount of ahi ahi fish and the dressing had a hint of wasabi soya inside, another winner here.\\n\\nFish tacos was ok for us, could be because we were so engrossed with the meal that it was left cold so we didn‚Äôt really have it at its prime lol\\n\\nOverall a wonderful lunch as a pit stop to have some great seafood.',\n",

But it is absolutely a 5 star in food, value, and authentic hospitality. The food was absolutely delicious, service was fast and the location is to die for. We had the garlic wings and the shrimp Thai rice, but I wanted to order literally everything on the menu. We were out of there in under an hour and for a decent price. We eat Thai a LOT so it felt like a homey comfort to find this gem amongst the powerhouse restaurants of Malibu. Highly recommend!\",\n",

       "    'text': 'October 2023\\n\\nIt\\'s a damn good DIVE! :) Good spot for fair priced food, good quality, and served fast.\\n\\nI like this place, shanty shack vibe, hot, humid and all. The food is good, huge portions.\\n\\nMy reviews and the places I go to tend to steer towards value for what you\\'re paying. This place definitely gives you really good portion sizes, quality in their food, and a lot of value, that\\'s for sure. They don\\'t skimp.\\n\\nWhat impressed me was the Pad Thai noodles. They were not too sweet, were served at a really decent temperature, and they pack it full of chicken. So it\\'s not just all noodle, no action. LOL. I guess because too many people were coming in here with allergies, they cut back on the peanuts. If you\\'d like them in the dish, you just have to specify that you want them. Same holds true for the scallions. Adding the peanuts in the scallions I think makes all the difference in the world, and brings that fresh grassy note to the dish. So if you\\'re not allergic, go ahead, and splurge on nuts and grass.\\n\\nThe Thai fried rice was good too. Huge portion size, and packed full of chicken as well. They don\\'t skimp on the proteins here as you can tell. The flavor is great. You can tell they use a little bit of broth to flavor their rice. It was tasty, and the rice has a nice chew texture in your mouth.\\n\\nJust between these two dishes, I\\'d say you could feed minimum two people that were really big eaters, probably three if you all ate responsibly, maybe four if you ordered one more appetizer or a side dish or something.\\n\\nThe Thai iced tea is great, not overly sweet. It\\'s the typical Thai iced tea you would find in any other Thai establishment. Nothing special, but simple and to the point.\\n\\nThe only downside to this place when I visited on a \"warm\" 70F degree, October day was that the main dining area was a little hot and humid, even with the windows open, and a small air conditioner blasting. I think it\\'s because the sun is blasting this place at a 45¬∞ angle from morning through the late afternoon.\\n\\nThe outside of the building has seen better days, but for being about 300 ft from the water, it\\'s understandable that this place looks like a Beach Shack from the outside.\\n\\nOver all though, this is one of the few places in the Malibu area, between Topanga and say Kanan that offers Asian themed food.\\nIf fancy schmancy is your cup of tea, just take it to go. Lol. The food is still great either way.\\n\\nIf you\\'re staying at a bed and breakfast, out of town visitor, maybe you\\'re a roaming pack of wild motorcycle riders, or bicycle Enthusiast passing through the area, this might be a good spot for inexpensive, quality food, and a great price! Don\\'t expect anything in terms of the atmosphere, but if food is your only agenda, this place aims to please.\\n\\nPS: YES, they have separate Men and Women bathrooms',\n",

       "    'text': \"Mastro's is a restaurant that promises a memorable dining experience, but our visit had a rocky start due to a frustrating reservation issue. Despite making reservations two weeks in advance and specifically requesting a window seat, we were disappointed to find out upon arrival that our seating preference could not be accommodated as promised. This initial hiccup was exacerbated by a rude hostess who seemed disinterested in providing good customer service.\\n\\nHowever, once we were finally seated, the evening took a turn for the better. The exceptional quality of food and service that followed truly made up for the initial inconvenience. We had 5 bottles of wine opened, each subject to a reasonable corkage fee of $50 per bottle, which added to the overall experience. It was a nice touch to be able to enjoy our own selection of wine with our meal.\\n\\nFrom the perfectly cooked filet mignon, ribeye, Chilean seabass with scallops, to the impressive 40 oz dry-aged Wagyu Tomahawk steak, every dish was a culinary delight.\\n\\nOur server was attentive and accommodating, despite the restaurant being packed. He ensured that our dining experience was nothing short of exceptional, making sure our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed.\\n\\nThe only other drawback of the evening was the lackluster music playing in the background, which did not quite match the high standard of the rest of the experience.\\n\\nOverall, Mastro's proved itself to be a top-notch dining establishment with exceptional food and service, even if the reservation process and initial seating experience left something to be desired. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a special dining experience, as the quality of the food and service truly shines once you are seated and ready to enjoy your meal.\",\n",

It came with loads of whip cream on the side to dip your bites in if you so desired and was the perfectly sized dessert for us, as we're not the biggest dessert people!\\n\\nThe views and vibes are also immaculate - we were directly by the window but were still able to enjoy the gorgeous view outside as the sun began to go down.\\nThere's also a few lovely areas just outside the restaurant for some photos - if you so desire.\\n\\nTo close, Mastro's Ocean Club in Malibu is the PERFECT location for celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and other special occasions!\\nWe were wonderfully treated throughout the evening, enjoyed everything we ordered, and would certainly be happy to return in the future!\\n\\nI felt this was an excellent value for the quality and ambiance of the experience!\",\n",

The restaurant closes at 10pm on Fridays, but I suspect that since it was a slow night with only our table of 4 left, they wanted to close early.

The chicken is perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and the waffles are light, fluffy, and golden. The combination is absolutely divine, with just the right balance of savory and sweet. The beautiful ambiance only adds to the experience, and the setting is enhanced by a charming turtle habitat right next to the cafe, with plenty of turtles lounging on a rock. It's such a peaceful and unique touch. If you're a fan of chicken and waffles or just want to enjoy a lovely atmosphere, this place is a must-visit!\",\n",

       "    'text': 'La Paz in Calabasas is hands down one of my favorite spots for authentic and flavorful Mexican cuisine. Every visit feels like a special treat, and the food is consistently amazing.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs start with the guacamole and chips‚Äîabsolutely fresh, perfectly seasoned, and always a crowd-pleaser. The guacamole is creamy with just the right amount of zing, and the chips are crispy and warm, making it an irresistible combination.\\n\\nI also love the burrito combo plate, which is always satisfying. The portions are generous, and the flavors are spot on. Each bite is packed with savory goodness, and it‚Äôs clear that every ingredient is thoughtfully prepared.\\n\\nThe calamari is a surprise standout for a Mexican restaurant. Lightly fried and seasoned to perfection, it‚Äôs tender with a delightful crunch, and a great choice if you‚Äôre looking for something unique to pair with your meal.\\n\\nAnd the drinks? The Cadillac Margarita is one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs smooth, strong, and perfectly balanced‚Äînot too sweet or overpowering. A must-have with your meal!\\n\\nBeyond the incredible food, Oscar, the owner, truly sets La Paz apart. He‚Äôs always checking on guests, ensuring everyone feels welcomed and well taken care of. His personal touch adds to the warm and inviting atmosphere that makes every visit memorable.\\n\\nWhether it‚Äôs a casual night out or a special occasion, La Paz never disappoints. The service is exceptional, the food keeps me coming back time and time again, and Oscar‚Äôs attention to his guests makes it feel like dining with family. Highly recommend!',\n",

       "    'text': 'La Paz in Calabasas is hands down one of my favorite spots for authentic and flavorful Mexican cuisine. Every visit feels like a special treat, and the food is consistently amazing.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs start with the guacamole and chips‚Äîabsolutely fresh, perfectly seasoned, and always a crowd-pleaser. The guacamole is creamy with just the right amount of zing, and the chips are crispy and warm, making it an irresistible combination.\\n\\nI also love the burrito combo plate, which is always satisfying. The portions are generous, and the flavors are spot on. Each bite is packed with savory goodness, and it‚Äôs clear that every ingredient is thoughtfully prepared.\\n\\nThe calamari is a surprise standout for a Mexican restaurant. Lightly fried and seasoned to perfection, it‚Äôs tender with a delightful crunch, and a great choice if you‚Äôre looking for something unique to pair with your meal.\\n\\nAnd the drinks? The Cadillac Margarita is one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs smooth, strong, and perfectly balanced‚Äînot too sweet or overpowering. A must-have with your meal!\\n\\nBeyond the incredible food, Oscar, the owner, truly sets La Paz apart. He‚Äôs always checking on guests, ensuring everyone feels welcomed and well taken care of. His personal touch adds to the warm and inviting atmosphere that makes every visit memorable.\\n\\nWhether it‚Äôs a casual night out or a special occasion, La Paz never disappoints. The service is exceptional, the food keeps me coming back time and time again, and Oscar‚Äôs attention to his guests makes it feel like dining with family. Highly recommend!',\n",

We got the Buffalo wings, tri-tip salad, and smoked brisket dinner, and literally the only thing that was good was the garlic bread that came out before everything else. Honestly, it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to mess up garlic bread though. The Buffalo wings had barely any sauce and tasted frozen (and even Pizza Hut has better Buffalo wings‚Ä¶these are certainly not ‚Äúkiller‚Äù), the tri-tip steak was extremely chewy and tough, and the brisket was the worst brisket we have ever had. Not moist, not tender, and it tasted like bland, boiled Dollar Store steak. Even the barbecue sauce that came with it wasn‚Äôt good!! How is that even possible?! The mac and cheese side was so different from Kraft mac and cheese, and the peanut Cole slaw was the only side somewhat decent. Ridiculously overpriced for the quantity and quality you get, and I cannot ever recommend this place. It‚Äôs like the owner visited Texas one weekend and thought they learned all there was to know about making good barbecue. Obviously, they did not. So avoid it!!',\n",

       "    'text': 'Quite  disgusted with the behavior of the staff at the spa , particularly Hanna.. When I enter a spa, I expect to be greeted. Not looked at and then look away. I expect to be treated just like every other patron and acknowledged , Especially when no one else is being assisted at the same time.   after Being ignored, I approached the desk and was asked by Hannah if I needed anything. I told her I would like to be shown the spa facility and to determine what type of treatment I want before I book a treatment and to explained the signature treatment that they offer. She rudely told me that they can‚Äôt give me a tour because they are people in treatments as if I am stupid and as if I was asking to go in the room where someone is giving treatment obviously not! . I have a spa blog and have been over 85 spas in the USA alone , I‚Äôve never been told that I can‚Äôt see a facility. And not only that,  instead of explaining to me the signature treatments that they give, she handed me a  Pamphlet  and told me I can look at that. I had already viewed that before I came to the spa  and I was interested in the HydroVichy Renewal but wanted more information. If I need a pamphlet clearly it is all online. One can only wonder what else was it besides my physical  presence  made me get that sort of treatment at a place that is supposed to be high end.. Will not be coming here and I‚Äôm highly uncomfortable.  Currently working on switching hotels to somewhere more accepting,',\n",

       "    'text': 'TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! This place has a lot of dazzle camouflage. The grounds are lovely and the room we had was a Spa King, which too was beautiful to look at. Now, the terrible part. My husband and I wanted a little spa day/overnight getaway last Thursday, so we thought we\\'d try the Westlake Village Inn. I called and spoke to Destiny and based on our criteria of a quiet room after our spa treatments, she recommended the Spa King because it\\'s a newer, nicer area of the resort. She also booked our treatments for us and let us know that we would get 20% off since we were booking a package. So far so good. Next day we arrive and check in. Not overly helpful as you have to park your own car (no valet) and navigate the property with your luggage in hand (no bellman) with a little map. It was annoying, but since it was an overnight bag we handled it. After finally finding our room, we headed to their restaurant, Stonehaus for a quick bite before our spa treatments. It\\'s not high end by any means. The food is gross and prepackaged, yet it took over 20 minutes to get it and it was a slow weekday at 2:30pm. We had a sandwich that had soggy bread and a wilted salad. Next, the spa. That was lovely to walk into and the front desk was very nice. The locker room was ridiculously small and crowded. There were 4 women in the one and only small locker area with 2 little benches trying to get dressed and undressed. Not one inch of privacy or space at all. The facilities are clean, but very lacking as well. Pool is packed and small. Not worth the price vs the Four Seasons a few miles away for just a tad more $$ and amazing facilities. The treatment was very nice and my masseuse, Riley was wonderful.\\nAfter our treatments we noticed that we didn\\'t receive the 20% off that was included in the package. I figured I\\'d address it at checkout as maybe they take the discounts off at the end of each stay. Next, we went back to our room to get comfortable and enjoy some down time. By 7pm, we were jarred from the heavy clomping footsteps above us. Then came voices from above. We had our patio doors closed, so we knew immediately that we were in for a loud experience. By 7:30pm it was even louder above us. Calling the front desk seemed useless as we realized how thin the walls were in our \"new\" room, meant that\\'s how all the walls were in the resort. Even if they would have moved us, we would have had to navigate the property alone in the dark with our luggage and a little map, since they had no one helping guests to their rooms. We packed up and left the resort. Such a huge disappointment and waste of $500+.\\nThe next morning, I called the front desk to let them know that we had such a bad experience that we left last night and were out of the room already for checkout. I also informed them that we didn\\'t receive our spa discount of 20% ($120) from our package. I was told that as soon as the manager came in he would look into it and call me or adjust our bill. NEVER HAPPENED! Not a call, not an email, nothing! This place is a joke! Spend a little extra money and go to the Four Seasons if you want quality. I cannot recommend any place that doesn\\'t cater to their guests or even address issues encountered by their guests. This is the epitome of poor service and I\\'d recommend not wasting your money on this place.',\n",

       "    'text': 'Quite  disgusted with the behavior of the staff at the spa , particularly Hanna.. When I enter a spa, I expect to be greeted. Not looked at and then look away. I expect to be treated just like every other patron and acknowledged , Especially when no one else is being assisted at the same time.   after Being ignored, I approached the desk and was asked by Hannah if I needed anything. I told her I would like to be shown the spa facility and to determine what type of treatment I want before I book a treatment and to explained the signature treatment that they offer. She rudely told me that they can‚Äôt give me a tour because they are people in treatments as if I am stupid and as if I was asking to go in the room where someone is giving treatment obviously not! . I have a spa blog and have been over 85 spas in the USA alone , I‚Äôve never been told that I can‚Äôt see a facility. And not only that,  instead of explaining to me the signature treatments that they give, she handed me a  Pamphlet  and told me I can look at that. I had already viewed that before I came to the spa  and I was interested in the HydroVichy Renewal but wanted more information. If I need a pamphlet clearly it is all online. One can only wonder what else was it besides my physical  presence  made me get that sort of treatment at a place that is supposed to be high end.. Will not be coming here and I‚Äôm highly uncomfortable.  Currently working on switching hotels to somewhere more accepting,',\n",

       "    'text': \"Stonehaus's best feature is its casual outdoor dining and delightful ambience. You're surrounded by a working vineyard, a waterfall, a private garden or two, and lush landscaping. There are also about a dozen tables under a patio cover if you want to avoid the sun completely or it's a rare rainy day. The food is good/average, although I can't recommend the seafood salad. The burgers are a generous size and tasty, but note that you must order fries separately unless you're happy with taro chips. The wine options are plentiful with a good array of choices. You order inside and are given a buzzer, requiring you to go pick up your food when it's ready. The presentation is definitely take-out quality served in disposable plates and utensils. On busy days, turn-around time for your order can be slow, so just order wine and kick back.  Parking can be hard to come by on weekends and holidays. After your meal, be sure to take the short stroll down to the scenic and flower-bordered lake and fountain behind the Inn.\",\n",

I say everyday because if I could, I would eat there every day.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with their veggie quinoa salad. Normally I don\\'t like ordering salads, but my gosh, this salad is so amazing, I crave it every day. When I was eating it again today, I heard  myself making \"mmmm\" noises. It was THAT GOOD!\\n\\nThe veggie quinoa salad has quinoa, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, heirloom cherry tomatoes, avocado, feta cheese, pepitas, and a most delicious red agave vinaigrette. Sounds simple but it tastes out of this world!\\n\\nAnother item I always get is their margherita pizza. It\\'s perfectly sized and delicious every time.\\n\\nUnless you reserve a private indoor tasting room for an event, all seating is outside. You feel like you\\'re dining in Tuscany. With the vineyard on the premises, the restaurant is beyond beautiful.\\n\\nStonehaus often has live music and is very social. A most delightful place to hang or relax.',\n",

As busy as the restaurant got by the time we left, I'd suggest more involvement from the bus staff. Being ignored by everyone and getting curt responses when talking to the waiter is not great when you're spending a lot of money to be there. Food however and ambience first rate.\",\n",

The tartar sauce was an excellent dipping option for the meal. The fries were good & went great with the ketchup.\\n\\nI‚Äôd definitely come back here again to try their other menu items.',\n",

Tried the chicken pasta as the sauce is creamy while the chicken breast stripe is fully seasoned and cooked, it comes out to be a huge bowl. Tried the prime rib in the french dip as the rib slices are sauced while additional sauce is offered. I had to say the bread is not as crispy as I thought which comes out to be a soft one. The Tiramisu is great as the staff tells me they make it everyday at the store. It comes out to be a huge one, which makes me totally full but with much happiness. The staff are really welcome, offering the refill for the tasty lemon juice and always ask about my dining experience. Might come back for brunch next time!',\n",

The server was phenomenal and the food delicious. The Fig Old Fashioned was perfect. He advised that I definitely just start with the roasted beet salad and I‚Äôm so glad I did. It was a huge salad and absolutely delicious. The server didn‚Äôt rush me and provided good tips for how to spend the rest of my day. It was a great experience all around.',\n",

We ordered gobi paratha and they served almost papad (hard) like paratha with no butter/oiling (how is that even a paratha if made in tandoor) and the dish description said stuffing of cauliflower with spices (there was minimal cauliflower and no spices at all in it)!! And we ordered chana puri hoping for some lip smacking authentic kala chana and thin and crispy puris instead we were served chhole (which tasted sweet) and the puris were the size of bhaturas (only difference between bhatura and puri was it was made with whole wheat dough). Also we ordered sweet lassi which looked and tasted like buttermilk (somebody needs to explain them the difference there) and it wasn‚Äôt even sweet!! The only good tasting item was the store bought mixed pickle üòÖüòÖAnd to top it all they were so slow..took almost an hour to get us the gobi paratha and chana puri when there were guests on just 2 other tables (not even a full house)!!',\n",

The Tortelli di Zucca was perfect - wonderful combination of flavors topped with crisped sage leaves. The NY strip was a very good cut of meat, perfectly cooked, but seemed completely unseasoned.

My wife ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad. Both were very generous portions and very flavorful. Even the iced tea cup was huge. There is so much to visually look at in the restaurant it defies description. although it is fun to talk about during your visit. Service was spot on to add to a great experience. Well worth the trip if you are in the area. Also a better option than the cafe at the Getty Villa in my book.\",\n",

Sauteed spinach with garlic was very good. And the dirty martini definitely hit the spot. I know this place has been here for quite a while and maybe they've done some updates but I really had a good time and like the place. I think you should come by sit at the bar for a drink maybe a meal or make some reservations with friends or even a party. They do have valet parking for a dollars, or there is plenty of street parking around. Cheers\",\n",

He said I had ordered a salad. The way he phrased it was very embarrassing, as if I was too stupid to place an order.\\n\\nHe eventually started to make the sandwich and forgot to toast it.\\n\\nHe delivered the sandwich, and when I said I wanted it toasted, he said I wanted it untoasted, and now it would be too late.\\n\\nI hated it.\\n\\nNow: we went with friends. He charged us their sandwich - and we paid for theirs - the difference was easy to see, as they had the combo - and we had just a sandwich.

The plaza where this restrauant is at is basically a ghost town because there only like 3 restrauant left here before they shut down. We arrived early so I checked in with the host and it took about 5ish minutes to be seated. The place is kind of outdated but we found out by our waiter that they will be moving to their new location within 6 days. Our waiter was Lars and he was amazing with us. My sister got her calamari and asked for the sauce to be on the side. My wife got the Sea Bass and asked for mushroom for her side. I went with the Bone In New York Steam and got fries on the side. They told me that the Bone in New York Steak come with a special knife so I get to choose which one I wanted. My sister friend got their Filet Mignon and shrimp. All of our food was delicious and I liked the seasoning on my NY steak. I would highly recommend coming here after they moved to their new location.\\n\\nMy score:\\n\\nFood: 5 star, you cannot go wrong with any steak here and their seafood options are amazing.\\n\\nService: 5 star, the customer service here are amazing as well since it's a luxury restaurant. All of the waiters are nice and will be attentive to your table.\\n\\nParking: 5 star, you will not have any issues finding parking here since there only 3 restrauant left and everything else is closed.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 4 star, the place is outdated which is why they are finally moving to their new location.\",\n",

This historic Art Deco gem perfectly blends old-world charm with modern luxury. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was captivated by the elegant ambiance and impeccable attention to detail. Every employee interaction was exceptional. The spacious and beautifully appointed room offered a comfortable king bed and luxurious amenities. The hotel's restaurant provided a delightful culinary experience with a menu featuring fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. The Georgian's prime location, just steps away from the iconic Santa Monica Pier and the beach, made it easy to explore all that the area has to offer. Whether you're seeking a romantic getaway, a family vacation, or a business trip, The Georgian Hotel is the perfect choice. I highly recommend this exceptional property to anyone looking for a truly unforgettable experience in Santa Monica.\",\n",

I couldn't stay that long because I had to go back to the airport. I really wanted to have some food and enjoy the scenery and the hostess was so nice to still seat me even though I had no reservation nor was I there at the correct time. I really appreciate how kind and understanding the staff was. I enjoyed some very yummy appetizers and loved the view. Highly recommended üëå\",\n",

My fianc√© and I came here to celebrate a very special occasion and one of the entr√©es we ordered was the wagyu ribeye ‚ÄúWestholme Wagyu‚Äù. Initially there was some issues with the mistake in regards to how it was cooked versus ordered. They quickly came and took it back to fix it, which unfortunately resulted in the steak becoming overly chard (something that can quite easily happen with such a high fat/marble content).  The manager came over and not only apologized, but took both entr√©es back and remade the full meal! Not only that, but they brought a free drink while waiting, and added a free side dish to our meal.\\n\\nWhen our meals came back out, they were both done perfectly, and they were both quite delicious (the other meal being the spaghetti and Wagyu meatballs). The whole team at the restaurant was very kind, friendly, apologetic, and provided top-notch service the whole time.\\n\\nPS- they even brought us a nice little dessert presentation for our celebration!!',\n",

Ordered the Frito Mistook for appetizers, because they did name the restaurant after this dish and it did not disappoint. It was perfect, came out hot, not greasy but crunchy on the outside and juicy on the vegetables and seafood. We ordered the garlic shrimp and the artichoke shrimp gnocchi. All the pasta was handmade, the portions was incredibly generous. When they said garlic shrimp, they made sure you got a ton of shrimp. Pasta was cooked to al dente, the texture, the bite and chew was perfect. The gnocchi was really good too, loved the sauce though be warned it could be a little sour because of the artichoke but I loved it. Finally we ordered the tiramisu to share and again perfect fluff and right amount of sweetness. We also got a slice of chocolate cake on the house and it was very rich. I had a smile on my face the entire lunch, after leaving the restaurant, the flight back to Seattle, and in fact I'm still smiling right now as I write this review.\",\n",

Apparently, they somehow ‚Äúrequire‚Äù guests to ask permission to sit at the bar and pretend that this is a typical restaurant practice.

But what really let this place down was the service a lot of staff standing around, they have this great sign system that you flip to red for service well would be great if staff came.  I wanted to walk out after trying to get bill and pay, it took SO LONG after asking staff and them saying your server will help you when he did finally came he threw it on the table sliding it and walked off and didn't return, we got up with bill and card still trying to pay chasing staff.

       "    'text': \"6 months ago, I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars. Today, I'm deciding if I want to wait  25 minutes for my favorite pizza. Multiple large booths open( Sunday at 6:30 pm we are a party of 5). Puke and pee in the walkways from the upstairs parking that you're forced to park at and now pay( Certain hours ). It's sad that this place is going downhill.  I used to live in at the ones in Orange County because of the atmosphere and service, I ended up apologizing to my kids for making them come there so I could get my favorite pizza. Maybe takeout only now. The one good thing was that the server was on his game.  P.S. check your silverware. 6 of ours had food on them still. Good luck!\\n\\nI decided to go back after more than two years. Still forced to park on the roof of the structure and walk through pee and litter to get down to the restaurant. Inside was much more busy, but the staff was on top of everything. The food came quickly. The waiter and staff kept checking on us. At the end of the night, I explained to the new manager about the conditions that I spoke about years ago still being there. She said she would look into it. I guess we'll see. Also, on the way back out, it was now nighttime, and the lights in the stairs were not working. The picture of all black is literally what the staircase looked like as you entered it from the top level. GOOD LUCK\\nEDIT AGAIN. 9/24 I've stayed away from this place, but my wife decided to do a curbside pick-up order on the app. After placing her order, she drove over and parked next to the curbside pickup area. Because regular patrons were parked in that area. The app said the food would be ready soon, so she checked in. She did receive notice that the food was ready, so she waited for a few minutes, nobody came out. So she rechecked in, and the app reconfirmed that she had already checked in and that an associate would be out shortly. She waited 10 more minutes and called the phone number that's posted on the sign in the area you're supposed to park. She was then informed they no longer do curbside pick up, and she would have to come into the store to pick it up. So basically, the food sat for fifteen minutes for no reason. If this is a BJ corporation, thing, how about fixing your app? But I suspect it's some kind of local decision by this restaurant only.\",\n",

We did make reservations which was good because the place was full and there were folks waiting to seat. We were greeted with smile and they sat us down immediately. The atmosphere was perfect. Our server Mandy was excellent and she made the experience that much more special. The food was delicious. We shared a wedge salad and lobster carbonara and ended it with a chocolate cake.

Me and my family got the ‚ÄúUltimate,‚Äù all you can eat shrimp. It was so yummy, we had many of the different dishes, pictured you can find the coconut shrimp, linguine, and skewers. Everything was seasoned well and tasted so good. We also had the lobster dip, which was mouth watering. The biscuits are delicious as usual and soft. I got the $7 riptide margarita, it had plenty of alcohol and pairs well with all the shrimp dishes. All the food was fresh and we enjoyed it. The waiter Andrew was very nice and helpful. It‚Äôs recommended that you save the pasta for last, the best part is that you get to take home whatever you ordered but once you box it, no more shrimp orders. Highly recommended and it‚Äôs very affordable. I can‚Äôt wait to go back!',\n",

Despite the bustling crowd, we were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation, and the festive atmosphere added to the holiday spirit.\\n\\nEl Torito lived up to its reputation, offering the familiar and comforting Mexican fare we expected. The guacamole made fresh at our table, coupled with yummy margaritas, bottomless chips, and salsa, set the perfect tone for a family-friendly dining experience. What made it even better was the affordability that El Torito consistently delivers.\\n\\nEven with the holiday rush and what seemed like a shortage of staff, our waiter hustled to ensure our party was well attended to. It was heartwarming to see the dedication despite the challenges. The presence of multiple screens playing the football game made the experience even more enjoyable, especially for my dad and brother who appreciated the view from our table.\\n\\nOverall, El Torito provided a warm and inviting setting for a holiday meal, with the staff's hard work shining through. A fine time indeed, with good food, family, and a touch of holiday cheer.\",\n",

Overall, If you have room in your finances to treat yourself and a loved one out to delicious meal in fine dinning category, I would recommend treating your family with Flemmings Steak House in Woodland Hills. Be mindful however, expect to pay 4 Bills-two people after being kind to the  waiter and 3 drinks, 2 sides, an lobster tail side, dessert, and 2 main dishes carefree of the menu prices.  Those Brussel Sprouts man! They have a carmelized vinaigrette deliciousness I can still reminisce on and I really cant get over, no joke. Felt like Gordon Ramsey was in kitchen with their pallet there on that choice highly, highly recommend. We needed our waiters help with fine precision to our curiosity trying to pinpoint all the flavors there. The Champagne Brie Cheese is good, but, the Bread with thee Smoked Cheddar Thyme Cheese spread was even more delightful. Thee Blueberey Lemon drop, what you see with the martini glass in our photos, was very delicious, and my gf and I would both recommend to anyone visiting their bar. The California Jam Jar was refreshing with the basil aroma, but was nothing special out of the ordinary. The Tomahawk steak, and my gf's New York Steak was delicious, we both had to take leftovers home, there was just too much to eat though I didnt eat all day, 14 hrs prior,  I still was too full to finish anything with two rounds/loaves of bread. The macaroni is also very unique and delicious, props to chefs here on the sides, they were so delicious! If we come back,we will try to try the creamy spinich next time. My gf beat me to  almost the whole lava cake; I almost didnt get to try it while tending to the bill lol, it was also very delightful. My Lobster tail was delicious and was my first ever lobster tail, so I cant say much beyond that. The dipping with melted butter they burn over the table was very nice. Was a very enjoyable, nice Valentines evening for my gf and myself; To Flemmings Staff for that elegant Valentines 2024 experience, thankyou.\",\n",

The lights are SO bright and the music is so loud and cheesy (Top 40 playlist). It doesn‚Äôt feel like a premium steakhouse at all anymore. They might have been going for ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and ‚Äútrendy‚Äù but achieved neither. It felt cheap, uncomfortable and off putting. To their credit, the waitstaff couldn‚Äôt have been nicer but they were unable to adjust the lights or music due to corporate‚Äôs instruction. We hope they will address this feedback quickly, and have to imagine other guests have shared similar feedback. We are frequent diners at this location but will not be back unless the atmosphere changes. Again, I don‚Äôt want this to take anything away from the staff who were amazing!!',\n",

       "    'text': \"update from 2024...Kirk our server was friendly and attentive.  The Caprese salad, Wagyu filet, and creme brulee were all great.  The shrimp calabria had zero flavor and the shrimp did not taste fresh.  The green beans tasted like the just had Sambal paste dumped on them and they were cold.  Sent them back to be heated.  Suspect the beans by themselves would have been excellent as they looked very young and fresh.  The onion rings are nothing to brag about especially since they looked and tasted like frozen rings.   We like dining on the patio in the fresh air.\\n\\nfrom 2022 Unfortunately this was one of the worst experiences we've had at the Woodland Hills location.  We dined outside on the patio as in the past.  It took approx 30 minutes to bring the bread and our drinks and then Jay our server brought a red wine for Jim (he ordered a chardonnay) and my wine carafe had hair in it.  Both drinks were replaced.  It took THREE requests for Jay to fix our wobbly table; 1st time he said the busser would fix it, then said the manager would 2 times.  Had to ask for water refills.  He did not know the menu after six months at Mortons; he claimed the patio menu was different - it's not.  My shrimp Alexander was lukewarm.  He brought my husband's requested desert but never asked me what I wanted for desert.  Fortunately my husband's birthday dinner entree Wagyu was excellent.  Sadly the returned red wine was on our bill and had to ask to have it removed - did not receive a corrected bill.  Jay knew my husband is a LSC member and Jay claimed he had all the info from the hostess desk, yet we had to ask for the $25 bday reward to be included in the final check.  As much as we usually enjoy Landrys, this experience makes it difficult to want to return.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"You come here for the view of the beach which is the main attraction especially if you get a good seat. I decided to take my wife here for her birthday so I made reservations ahead of time off OpenTable and told them we were celebrating a birthday so I wanted a table with good view of the water. We arrived early and use their valet parking because it's easier than finding street parking. The valet cost is already added to your bill so you don't have to worry about cash except for tip. We arrived early so we took advantage on walking down to the beach first. We checked in like 20 minutes before our reservation time but they were still able to seat us with a great table with good view of the water. Our waiter was Marvin and we thought he was great with us beside not telling me that the soda is not free refill. That was my only complaint with him but I didn't want to dispute so I just paid it but give less in the tip. My wife got the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass for her entree and a Georgia Peach martini for her drink. I got their Herb Crusted Salmon and ask for french fries for my sides. My wife loved her peach martini and of course her Sea Bass. I thought the Salmon was a bit dry and didn't have much favor but Marvin came around asking if I wanted crushed black pepper so I asked for that on the Salmon and fries. It helped a little but not that much to me. We finish off the night with a ice cream dessert where Marvin sang Happy Birthday to my wife. I would recommend coming here and making reservations if you want to experience a good view and some good food but just know that the soda does not have free refills.\",\n",

The valet crew is so awesome and as always takes care of everyone with a smile! They were great with our driver. Super polite and accommodating when he dropped us off and picked us up.\\nWe love to sit at the bar.  If you do this make sure you sit on the far side so you can see the ocean.  Our bartender was great!  Lots of personality and really enjoyed our time there.\\nThe food as always was excellent! We went on a Sunday.  Sat and Sunday they have a great brunch menu.',\n",

       "    'text': \"You come here for the view of the beach which is the main attraction especially if you get a good seat. I decided to take my wife here for her birthday so I made reservations ahead of time off OpenTable and told them we were celebrating a birthday so I wanted a table with good view of the water. We arrived early and use their valet parking because it's easier than finding street parking. The valet cost is already added to your bill so you don't have to worry about cash except for tip. We arrived early so we took advantage on walking down to the beach first. We checked in like 20 minutes before our reservation time but they were still able to seat us with a great table with good view of the water. Our waiter was Marvin and we thought he was great with us beside not telling me that the soda is not free refill. That was my only complaint with him but I didn't want to dispute so I just paid it but give less in the tip. My wife got the Pan Seared Chilean Sea Bass for her entree and a Georgia Peach martini for her drink. I got their Herb Crusted Salmon and ask for french fries for my sides. My wife loved her peach martini and of course her Sea Bass. I thought the Salmon was a bit dry and didn't have much favor but Marvin came around asking if I wanted crushed black pepper so I asked for that on the Salmon and fries. It helped a little but not that much to me. We finish off the night with a ice cream dessert where Marvin sang Happy Birthday to my wife. I would recommend coming here and making reservations if you want to experience a good view and some good food but just know that the soda does not have free refills.\",\n",

Still same great service, food, and atmosphere!  Keep in mind if you choose to park on your own, good luck!  Highly recommend either car service or valet. The valet crew is so awesome and as always takes care of everyone with a smile! They were great with our driver. Super polite and accommodating when he dropped us off and picked us up.\\nWe love to sit at the bar.  If you do this make sure you sit on the far side so you can see the ocean.  Our bartender was great!  Lots of personality and really enjoyed our time there.\\nThe food as always was excellent! We went on a Sunday.  Sat and Sunday they have a great brunch menu.',\n",
