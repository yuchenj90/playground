Problem:
    We would like to build a system to get a few best restaurants close to us based on google reviews. 
    
Approaches:
    1. We first need to get all restaurants near us. Using google API, we should be able to get all the information (get_all_restaurants.ipynb)
    2. 

We would like to know the true reviews of restaurant


API steps:
1. Go to cloud.google.com to sign up a free account
2. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis to create credentials
3. Copy API keys and paste it in .env file.
4. Enable Places API for your project here https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/api-list
