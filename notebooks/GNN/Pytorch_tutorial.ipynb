    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, deep learning on graphs has emerged to one of the hottest research fields in the deep learning community.\n",
    "Here, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** aim to generalize classical deep learning concepts to irregular structured data (in contrast to images or texts) and to enable neural networks to reason about objects and their relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce you to some fundamental concepts regarding deep learning on graphs via Graph Neural Networks based on the **[PyTorch Geometric (PyG) library](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric)**.\n",
    "PyTorch Geometric is an extension library to the popular deep learning framework [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and consists of various methods and utilities to ease the implementation of Graph Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Kipf et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907), let's dive into the world of GNNs by looking at a simple graph-structured example, the well-known [**Zachary's karate club network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary%27s_karate_club). This graph describes a social network of 34 members of a karate club and documents links between members who interacted outside the club. Here, we are interested in detecting communities that arise from the member's interaction."
